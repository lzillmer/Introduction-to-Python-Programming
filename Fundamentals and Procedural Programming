## NOTES

## print(message) - takes as input a message as string and prints it in console
print("Hello, world")

## print(type(myVariable)) - shows data type
myVariable = 5
print(type(myVariable))

## converting between data types, use:
# str(variable)
# int(variable)
# bool(variable) - Python lets you convert anything to a boolean
# float(variable)

myNumber = 5
print(type(myNumber))
myNumberAsString = str(myNumber)
print(type(myNumberAsString)

print("Today's date: " + str(date.today()))
print("Today's date:", date.today()) ## prints the same thing

myIntAsString = "5"
myIntAsInt = int(myIntAsString)
print(myIntAsInt)

## user input
myUserInput = input("Enger an integer: ") ## input will be interpreted as a string
myUserInputAsInt = int(myUserInput)
print(myUserInputAsInt * myUserInputAsInt)

## Python's reserved words
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist) ## shows Python's list of reserved words

# you get a SyntaxError if you try to use a reserved word

## Dot notation
import datetime
currentTime = datetime.datetime.now()
print(currentTime.hour)
print(currentTime.minute)
print(currentTime.second)

## Exercise: print date as year/month/day and time as hour:minute:second
from datetime import date
import datetime
todays_date = date.today()
current_time = datetime.datetime.now()

todays_year_string = str(todays_date.year)
todays_month_string = str(todays_date.month)

time_hour_string = str(current_time.hour)
time_minute_string = str(current_time.minute)
time_second_string = str(current_time.second)

print(time_hour_string + ":" + time_minute_string + ":" + time_second_string)

## set operators
myString = "hello, world"
print("h" in myString) ## output will be True
print("lo, w" in myString) ## output will be True

## Incrementing and loops
letterCount = 0
for character in "Hello, world":
  letterCount += 1
print(letterCount)    ## counts letters in Hello, world

## Checking if a triangle exists

## PRACTICE PROBLEMS

## Practice problem 1
old_balance = "500.45"
deposit = "10"

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Imagine you're writing code for an ATM that accepts cash
#deposits. You need to update the customer's balance based
#on a deposit amount. However, both the old balance and the
#deposit are given as strings.
#
#Write code below that will print the new balance after the
#deposit is processed. This should be printed along with
#the following text labeling the amount:
#
#The new balance is: 510.45
#
#Note that the old balance will always include change, but
#the deposit will never include change because the ATM has
#no coin slot, only a slot for paper money.
#
#With the initial values of the variables shown above, your
#code should print the text shown on line 17.

#Add your code here!
new_balance = float(old_balance) + float(deposit)
new_balance = str(new_balance)
print("The new balance is:", new_balance)


## Practice problem 2

balance = 500
income = 200
price = 1000
months = 6

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#You're thinking of buying a new computer. The variables
#above represent the balance of your bank account, your
#monthly disposable income, the total price of the computer,
#and the number of months that the retailer will give you to
#pay off the computer.
#
#You can buy the computer if either (a) you can afford to
#buy the computer in cash right now (balance is greater than
#price), or (b) you can afford the monthly payments (income
#is greater than price divided by months).
#
#In other words, if a computer cost $1200 and you spread it
#out over 12 months, you would need your monthly available
#income to be at least $100 to buy the computer, or you
#would need your current bank balance to be at least $1200.
#
#Add some code below that will print True if you're able to
#afford the computer given the values above, and False if you
#are not.

#Add your code below!
print(balance > price or income > price/months)


## Pracitce problem 3

hot = True
cold = False
rainy = True
windy = False
snowy = False

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Earlier, you wrote a program that made clothing
#recommendations based on the weather. Your program could
#specifically recommend a jacket, boots, flip-flips, or a
#tshirt based on whether it was hot, cold, rainy, windy, or
#snowy.
#
#Let's add some accessories to that program: a hat, gloves,
#umbrella, and a scarf.
#
#Specifically, the program should recommend:
#
# - a hat if it's cold, or if it's hot but not rainy (cold
#   and rainy still means a hat, though).
# - gloves if it's cold and either snowy or rainy.
# - an umbrella if it's hot, snowy, or rainy.
# - a scarf if it's cold and windy or cold and snowy
#   unless it's rainy. Rain means no scarf regardless of
#   whether it's cold, windy, or snowy.
#
#Write some code below that will print four lines, one for
#each of the four types of clothing. The lines should look
#like this:
#
#Hat: True
#Gloves: True
#Umbrella: False
#Scarf: False
#
#The values (True and False) will differ based on the
#values assigned to hot, cold, windy, snowy, and rainy
#at the start of the program.

#Add your code here!
print("Hat: " + str(cold or (hot and not rainy)))
print("Gloves: " + str(cold and (snowy or rainy)))
print("Umbrella: " + str(hot or snowy or rainy))
print("Scarf: " + str(((cold and windy) or (cold and snowy)) and not rainy))


## Practice problem 4

import datetime
start_date = datetime.date(2017, 2, 16)
end_date = datetime.date(2017, 2, 16)
start_time = datetime.time(4, 30, 0)
end_time = datetime.time(4, 30, 17)

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Above, there are four variables: start_date, end_date,
#start_time, and end_time. start_date and start_time together
#represent a certain time on a certain date, and end_date and
#end_time represent a different time on a different date.
#
#Add some code below that will print True if the end time
#occurs after the start time. Print False if the end time
#occurs before the start time. For example, 11:15:00 on
#01/01/2017 would be before 09:00:00 on 01/05/2017, which
#would be before 11:25:00 on 01/05/2017.
#
#Note that you may use dot notation to access the individual
#parts of the dates and times. You can access the hour,
#minute, and seconds from start_time with start_time.hour,
#start_time.minute, and start_time.second. You can access
#the year, month, and day of start_date with
#start_date.year, start_date.month, and start_date.day. You
#can use the same syntax to access the parts of end_date.
#Note that Python uses 24-hour time.
#
#Hint: You may use conditionals to solve this if you want,
#but you don't need to.
#
#Hint 2: You can use relational operators with both dates
#and times. start_time < end_time is True if start_time is
#before end_time. start_date >= end_date is True if
#start_date is later than end_date, or the same date. With
#this, you can avoid using dot notation altogether if
#you'd like.

#Add your code here!
print(end_date >= start_date and end_time > start_time)


## Practice problem 5

goal = 50000
rate = 0.05
years = 5

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Earlier, we created a program that would calculate the
#value of an investment account after a certain period of
#time using the formula Amount = Principal * e^(Rate * Time).
#
#Let's revisit that, but let's flip the question around.
#Instead of asking, "What will the value of this account
#be?", let's instead ask, "How much do I need to invest to
#have a certain amount by a certain year?" For example,
#"How much do I need to invest to have $50,000 in 5 years
#at 5% (0.05) interest?"
#
#Mathematically, the formula for this is:
#
#  goal / e ^ (rate * number of years) = principal
#
#Add some code below that will print the amount of principal
#needed to reach the given savings goal within the number of
#years and interest rate specified.
#
#In printing your response, you should round the answer to
#two decimal places. Remember, you can do this with this
#code (assuming that your principal is stored in a variable
#called 'principal'): rounded_principal = round(principal, 2)
#
#Remember, you can access e using math.e as long as you don't
#change the next line.
import math

#Add your code here!
principal = goal / math.e ** (rate * years)
rounded_principal = round(principal, 2)
print(rounded_principal)


## Practice problem 6

principal = 40000
rate = 0.05
years = 5
goal = 50000

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Last problem, we calculated how much money a person would
#have to invest to reach a certain savings goal. Now, let's
#modify that to instead take a principal, interest rate,
#number of years, and savings goal, and report whether or not
#the person will meet their savings goal.
#
#Add some code below that will calculate whether the
#investment described by the values above will meet the given
#goal. If it will, print True. If it will not, print False.
#
#As a reminder, the formula for the value of an account after
#a given time (in number of years) is:
#
#  Current Value = principal * e ^ (rate * number of years)
#
#Remember, you can access e using math.e as long as you don't
#change the next line. You don't need to worry about rounding
#on this problem.
import math

#Add your code here!
print(principal * math.e ** (rate * years) >= goal)

#
#Add some code that will write the text to appear on a wedding

#this would read:
#
#You are cordially invited to attend the wedding of Caitlin and David, to take place on November 3, 2012 at 5:00PM.
#
#Note that all components of this statement are required: start
#"You are cordially invited to attend the wedding of ", followed
#by spouse_1's name, followed by " and ", followed by spouse_2's
#name, then a comma and space, followed by "to take place on ",
#followed by the month, a space, the day, a comma and space, the
#year, a space, the word "at", a space, the time, and then a
#period.
#
#HINT: Copy the sentence below and replace the current values
#(Caitlin, David, November, etc.) with variables to reduce the
#risk of typoes throwing off your answers.

#Add your code here!

## Practice problem 8

amount = 17

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.
#
#The variable above describes an amount of money measured in
#dollars. Imagine you want to select the bills (1-dollar bills,
#5-dollar bills, 10-dollar bills, etc.) that make up that
#amount of money. For example, 17 dollars is one $10, one $5,
#and two $1s.
#
#Write a program that will print out the bills needed to
#arrive at the amount shown above. Assume that we always want
#the maximum number of large bills: for example, for 17 dollars,
#we want one $10, one $5, and two $1s, not three $5s and two $1s.
#You may assume that the largest bill you have on hand is a
#$50-dollar bill.
#
#Your code should print the following (with the correct numbers
#based on the value of amount):
#
#Fifties: 0
#Twenties: 0
#Tens: 1
#Fives: 1
#Ones: 2

#Add your code here!

print("Fifties:", amount//50)
remainder = amount - 50*(amount//50)

print("Twenties:", remainder//20)
remainder = remainder - 20*(remainder//20)

message = "lol"
punct = "!"
num = 3

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to

#Using the values of message, punct, and num, print
#a string that looks like the one below if message = "lol",
#punct = "!", and num = 3:
#
# !!!lollollol!!!lollollol!!!lollollol!!!
#
#Specifically, it should start by printing punct num
#times, then print message num times, repeat that entire
#process num times, and then print punct num times
#again.
#
#Here are a couple other examples:
#
# message = "bbl", punct = ":", num = 1 -> :bbl:
# message = "bbq", punct = "?", num = 2 -> "??bbqbbq??bbqbbq??
# message = "brb", punct = ".", num = 4 -> ....brbbrbbrbbrb....brbbrbbrbbrb....brbbrbbrbbrb....brbbrbbrbbrb....

num = 3

#-----------------------------------------------------------
#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to

#Write some code that calculates the cube of the number
#given by num. Then, print that number num^2 (num squared)
#times in a row, with no spaces or line breaks in between.
#
#For example, if num is 3, then your code would print:
#
# 272727272727272727
#
#That 27 9 times. 3 squared is 9, 3 cubed is 27, and so
#it prints 27 9 times.
#
#Note: these directions are slightly different from the
#preview we posted! You should be printing num^3 num^2
#times, not printing num^2 num^3 times.

#Add your code here!

## Problem 4

cost = 150000
rate = 0.0415
years = 15

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#When taking out a mortgage (a type of loan) for a house, the
#mortgage is defined by three variables: the total cost of the
#house, the interest rate at which you will pay back the
#mortgage, and how many months you have to pay back the
#mortgage.
#
#The formula to find the total amount of money that will be
#paid over that time is:
#
#  Cost * Number of Months * Monthly Rate /
#  (1 - ((1 + Monthly Rate) ^ -Number of Months))
#
#Note that both time and rate are based on months: to find the
#monhtly rate, divide the annual rate by 12. To find the number
#of months, multiply the number of years by 12.
#
#Write some code that prints out a sentence like the following
#based on the original cost, interest rate, and number of years
#given above:
#
# The total cost of the house will be $201751.36
#
#You should round the total cost to two decimal places. You can
#do this with this line, assuming the actual value of the
#mortgage is stored in final_cost: final_cost = round(final_cost, 2)


#Add your code here!
monthly_rate = rate/12

final_cost = (cost * months * monthly_rate) / (1 - ((1 + monthly_rate) ** -months))
rounded_final_cost = round(final_cost, 2)
print("The total cost of the house will be $" + str(rounded_final_cost))


## Problem 5

number = 215

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.
#
#The number above is given in base 10. Let's convert it to
#base 2 and print it in binary. For example, 215 can be written
#in binary as 11010111.
#
#Each digit of that string corresponds to a power of 2. The far
#left digit represents 128, then 64, then 32, then 16, then 8,
#then 4, then 2, and then finally 1 at the far right.
#
#To convert the number to binary, first check to see if it is
#greater than or equal to 128. If it is, your first digit is 1.
#If not, your first digit is 0. If the number was greater than
#128, subtract 128 (because the 128 is captured by the first
#digit of the string).
#
#Then, repeat that process for 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1.
#
#For example:
#
#215 is >= 128: 1
#87 is >= 64: 11
#23 is not >= 32: 110
#23 is >= 16: 1101
#7 is not >= 8: 11010
#7 is >= 4: 110101
#3 is >= 2: 1101011
#1 is >= 1: 11010111
#
#Note that although we use 'if' a lot to describe this problem,
#this can be done entirely with floor division and modulus.
#Remember, if you convert a boolean to an integer, True becomes
#1 and False becomes 0.
#
#Note that we always work with binary in 8-bit chunks: the
#number 7 would be 00000111, not just 111. That's because inside
#the computer, 8 1s and 0s make a byte, which is the smallest
#practical unit of storage (rarely are bits used outside 8-bit
#bytes).
#
#Print the string that results from this conversion.

#Add your code here!

digit_1 = int(number >= 128)

## Problem 7

num = 4

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Write some code that calculates the square and the square root
#of the number given above. Then, it should print the root the
#square number of times. If the square root is a decimal,
#round it down (you can do this by converting the decimal to
#an integer: Python will automatically round it down).
#
#For example, if num is 4, then your code would print:
#
# 2222222222222222
#
#That's 2 16 times. 4 squared is 16, the square root of 4 is 2,
#and so it prints 2 16 times.
#
#For another example: if num is 13, then 13 squared is 169, and
#the square root of 13 is ~3.6. 3.6 rounds down to 3. So, it would
#print 3 169 times.

#The variables above give some information about a baby's birth:
#the names of the parents, the name of the baby, and the month,
#day, year, and time of the wedding.
#
#Add some code that will write the text to appear on a birth
#announcement based on these values. For the values shown above,
#this would read:
#
#Lucy was born to Caitlin and David at January 2, 2015 at 11:12PM.
#
#Note that all components of this statement are required: the
#baby's name, " was born to ", the first parent's name, " and ",
#the second parent's name," at ", the month, the day, a comma, the
#year, " at ", the time, and a period.

## Problem 4

principal = 40000
rate = 0.05
years = 5
goal = 50000

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#The variables above represent the current status of an
#investment account. The variable principal represents the
#initial value of the account. The variable rate represents
#the interest rate. The variable years represents the number
#of years the account will be allowed to grow.
#
#The variable goal represents the amount of money the investor
#hopes to have saved up by the end of that time period.
#
#Add some code below that will calculate whether the
#investment described by the values above will meet the given
#goal. If it will, print True. If it will not, print False.
#
#The formula for the value of an account after a given time
#(in number of years) is:
#
#  Current Value = principal * e ^ (rate * number of years)
#
#Because of the next line, you may use the variable e to
#represent the value of e. For example, print(e * 2) would
#print 5.43656365691809, which is double the value of e.

# Problem 5
number = 1101

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.
#
#The number above represents a binary number. It will always
#be up to eight digits, and all eight digits will always be
#either 1 or 0.
#
#The string gives the binary representation of a number. In
#binary, each digit of that string corresponds to a power of
#2. The far left digit represents 128, then 64, then 32, then
#16, then 8, then 4, then 2, and then finally 1 at the far right.
#
#So, to convert the number to a decimal number, you want to (for
#example) add 128 to the total if the first digit is 1, 64 if the
#second digit is 1, 32 if the third digit is 1, etc.
#
#For example, 00001101 is the number 13: there is a 0 in the 128s
#place, 64s place, 32s place, 16s place, and 2s place. There are
#1s in the 8s, 4s, and 1s place. 8 + 4 + 1 = 13.
#
#Note that although we use 'if' a lot to describe this problem,
#this can be done entirely boolean logic and numerical comparisons.
#
#Print the number that results from this conversion.

#Add your code here!

# Convert the number to a string and calculate the length
binary_str = str(number)
length = len(binary_str)

# Calculate the decimal number
decimal_number = 0
power = length - 1

for digit in binary_str:
    decimal_number += int(digit) * (2 ** power)
    power -= 1

# Print the decimal number

## Problem 6

message = "lol"
punct = "!"
num = 3

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Using the values of message, punct, and num, print
#a string that looks like the one below if message = "lol",
#punct = "!", and num = 3:
#
# lollollol!lollollol!lollollol
#
#Specifically, it should start by printing message num times,
#then print punct. It should repeat that process num times,
#with punct printed between each time (but not at the start or
#end).
#
#Here are a couple other examples:
#
# message = "bbq", punct = "?", num = 2 -> bbqbbq?bbqbbq
# message = "bbl", punct = ":", num = 3 -> bblbblbbl:bblbblbbl:bblbblbbl
# message = "brb", punct = ".", num = 4 -> brbbrbbrbbrb.brbbrbbrbbrb.brbbrbbrbbrb.brbbrbbrbbrb

#Add your code below!
result = (message * num + punct) * (num - 1) + message * num

# Problem 7

num = 4

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Write some code that calculates the square and the square root
#of the number given above. Then, it should print the square the
#square root number of times. If the square root is a decimal,
#round it down (you can do this by converting the decimal to
#an integer: Python will automatically round it down).
#
#For example, if num is 4, then your code would print:
#
# 1616
#
#That's 16 2 times. 4 squared is 16, the square root of 4 is 2,
#and so it prints 16 2 times.
#
#For another example: if num is 13, then 13 squared is 169, and
#the square root of 13 is ~3.6. 3.6 rounds down to 3. So, it would
#print: 169169169, or 169 3 times.

#Add your code here!
sq = num ** 2
sqrt = num ** 0.5

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Imagine you're writing code for the cash register of a
#fast casual restaurant. For this restaurant, customers have
#the option to round up their total and donate the extra to
#charity. For example, if a customer's total was $5.45, they
#could round up to $6.00, and donate the extra $0.55 to
#charity.
#
#The variables original_total and donation represent these
#values; you may assume they will always add to a whole integer.
#Due to an error by another programmer, though, they are initially
#given to you as strings rather than floats.
#
#Write some code that will print the customer's total and
#how much they donated. This sentence should read as follows:
#
# Your total is $6 and you donated $0.55
#
#Note that because we always round up to a full dollar,
#the total should be printed as an integer. Make sure the
#dollar signs are in the right place, with no spaces following
#the dollar signs.

#Add your code here!

#assign different values to the variables.

#Write a program that will determine what kind of plans you
#could make based on what kind of day it is and what the
#weather is like.
#
#You have three variables to use in these decisions:
#
# - is_weekend, whether it's a weekend day
# - is_holiday, whether it's a holiday
# - is_rainy, whether it's going to be raining
#
#Your four options are:
#
# - Beach, if it's both a holiday and a weekend as long as
#   it's _not_ raining. If it's raining, the beach is not
#   an option.
# - Lake, if it's a weekend and not raining. It doesn't
#   matter if it's a holiday or not.
# - Park, if it's not raining. It doesn't matter whether
#   it's a weekend or holiday.
# - Home, if it's raining, or if it's neither a weekend
#   nor a holiday.
#
#In other words: the Beach is an option on holiday weekends
#when the weather is good. The Lake is an option on regular
#weekends when the weather is good. The Park is an option
#any time the weather is good. Home is an option if it's
#raining, or if it's not a weekday that isn't a holiday.

#
#Print your results like this, based on whether each is
#an option according to the logic above:
#
# - Beach: False
# - Lake: True
# - Park: True

#
#The general form would be:
# You should submit Assignment [assignment_num] by [day], [month] [date] at [time].

## Problem 4

value = 100
quantity = 5
interest = 0.02
dividend = 1.05
dividend_frequency = 4
years = 10
goal = 250

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Typically when you purchase a stock on the stock market, you
#do so with the hope that it will increase in value, and you
#can then sell it for a profit.
#
#Some stocks also pay dividends. A dividend is a small amount
#of money that a stock pays its owners on a regular interval.
#For example, if a stock pays a $1.05 dividend 4 times a year,
#then for each share of the stock you own, you would receive
#$4.20 per year.
#
#The variables above give a number of parameters for a
#particular stock purchase you are considering:
#
# - value, the current value of the stock
# - quantity, the number of shares you may buy
# - interest, the estimated yearly interest rate it will earn
# - dividend, the predicted value of the dividend it will pay
# - dividend_frequency, the predicted frequency with which it
#   will pay that dividend
# - years, the number of years you plan to hold the stock
# - goal, the amount of money you want to earn from the
#   investment
#
#Your goal is to print True if this investment will meet your
#savings goal, and False if it will not. In other words, if
#the total amount of money you will earn from the stock --
#including its initial value, interest, and dividends -- is
#greater than goal, you print True. Otherwise, you print False.
#
#You can find the total amount of money generated by dividends
#by multiplying the dividend by its yearly frequency by the
#number of years.
#
#The formula for the current value of an investment based on
#its initial value, its interest rate, and its years of investment
#is:
#
# new value = initial value * e ^ (interest rate * number of years)
#
#The variable interest can be put directly into this formula (you
#do not need to add 1). The following line of code will let you use
#the variable e in your code for e:
from math import e

#Remember, your only goal is to print True if you should buy the
#stock, False if you should not. Using the initial values of the
#variables above, this would initially print False: the total
#value would be around $164, well short of the goal of $250.

#Add your code here!
dividend = dividend * dividend_frequency * years
print(goal <= value * e ** (interest * years) + dividend)

#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#A donut shop sells donuts in four sizes: packs of 60 donuts,
#packs of 12 donuts, packs of 3 donuts, and individual donuts.
#
#To divide donuts into packs, they start by making as many of
#the largest pack as they can. Then, they make as many of the
#next largest pack, then the next pack, then finally they sell
#the remaining donuts individually. For example, if they baked
#119 donuts, then they would divide those donuts into one
#pack of 60, four packs of 12, three packs of 3, and 2
#individual donuts.
#
#Based on the variable donuts above, calculate how many of
#each size they will make. Print the results according to
#this template:
#
#Packs of 60: 1
#Packs of 12: 4
#Packs of 3: 3
#Packs of 1: 2

#Add your code here!

#
#Write a program that will generate a bad password according to
#a similar formula. Specifically, the variables above -- num_a,
#num_b, num_c, num_d, and num_e -- give you 5 integers. Your
#password should be: num_a num_b times, num_b num_c times,
#num_c num_d times, num_d num_e times, and num_e num_a times, in
#that order. Then, the entire password should repeat num_z times.
