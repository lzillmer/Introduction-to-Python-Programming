#Write a function called random_marks. random_marks should
#take three parameters, all integers. It should return a
#string.
#
#The first parameter represents how many apostrophes should
#be in the string. The second parameter represents how many
#quotation marks should be in the string. The third
#parameter represents how many apostrophe-quotation mark
#pairs should be in the string.
#
#For example, random_marks(3, 2, 3) would return this
#string: #'''""'"'"'"

#Note that there are three apostrophes, then two quotation
#marks, then three '" pairs.


#Add your function here!

#Add your code to create the dictionary as described!
#The first item in each tuple should be a key, and
#the second item in each tuple should be its value.
#Note that you may create this either by reading and
#using the ta_info list of tuples, or you can create
#the dictionary from scratch:


#Create your dictionary here!
ta_dict = {"Joshua":"Georgia", "Jackie":"Vermont", "Marguerite":"Tennessee"}


#Now, create three variables: josh_val, jack_val, and
#marg_val. Set josh_val equal to Josh's dictionary value,
#then jack_val equal to Jackie's, then marg_val equal to
#Marguerite's. Remember how to properly access the value
#corresponding to a dictionary key!
#
#Make sure you use dictionary-access syntax to do this.
#Don't create the variables based on new values.

#Create your variables here!

#  count_characters("AaBbbb") -> {'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'a': 1, 'b': 3}

### PROBLEM SET 1 ###

## Practice problem 1

#Write a function called count_types. count_types
#should take as input a single string, and return a
#dictionary. In the dictionary, the keys should be
#types of characters, and the values should be the
#number of times each type of character appeared in
#the string.
#
#The types of characters that should be handled (and
#thus, the keys in the dictionary) are:
#
# - upper: the count of upper-case or capital letters
# - lower: the count of lower-case letters
# - punctuation: the count of punctuation characters.
#   You may assume this is limited to these punctuation
#   characters: !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
# - space: the count of spaces
# - numeral: the count of numerals, 0123456789
#
#Note, however, that any type of character that does
#NOT appear in the string should not be in the dictionary
#at all.
#
#For example:
#
#count_characters("aabbccc") -> 
# {"lower": 7}
#count_characters("ABC 123 doe ray me!") -> 
# {"upper": 3, "lower": 8, "punctuation": 1, "space": 4, "numeral": 3}
#
#Because the first string has only lower-case letters,
#"lower" is the only key in the dictionary.

#dictionary.
#
#The string will represent the filename to which to write.
#
#The keys in the dictionary will be strings representing
#movie titles. The values in the dictionary will be lists
#of strings representing performers in the corresponding
#movie.
#
#write_movie_info should write the list of movies to the file
#given by the filename using the following format:
#
# Title: Actor 1, Actor 2, Actor 3, etc.
#
#The movies and the actor names should be sorted
#alphabetically.

## Practice problem 3

#Imagine you're writing the code for an onboard vehicle
#monitoring system. One thing the system does is measure
#tire pressure. It does this by taking a measurement every
#10 seconds. However, lots of environmental conditions can
#lead to intermittent bad readings: if it takes a reading
#as a car goes over a bump, for example, it will be way
#higher than it would have been otherwise. So, the system
#needs to know to ignore these ratings, as well as only
#process the more recent measurements. Let's tell the system
#that the only valid tire pressures are between 15 and 55.
#
#Write a function called tire_pressure. tire_pressure
#should have one parameter, a list of integers. The list
#represents a series of tire pressure measurements over the
#past several minutes.
#
#tire_pressure should return the average of the last 5
#measurements that are greater than or equal to 15 and less
#than or equal to 55. Round the result to 1 decimal place
#(you can use round(some_float, 1) to round to 1 decimal
#place).

#For example, if the list of measurements was this:

#tire_pressure would return 35.0: the last five measurements
#in range are all 35. You may assume there will be at least

#in the file after they're sorted.
#
#If there is an even number of values in the file, then
#find_median should return the average of the two middle
#values after they're sorted.
#
#For example, in the dropdown in the top left you'll find a
#file named FindMedianInput.txt. There are 19 numbers in
#this file, so the median is the value at index 10 after
#sorting them: 16.

#Write a function called next_fib. next_fib should take
#have two parameters: a list of integers and a single integer.
#For this description, we'll call the single integer n.
#
#next_fib should modify the list to add the next n pseudo-
#Fibonacci numbers to the end of the sequence. A pseudo-
#Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two numbers in
#the sequence, but in our case, the previous two numbers may
#not be the original numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.
#
#For example, if the original list given was:
#
# a_list = [5, 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 65]

#three new ones have been added.
#
#You may assume the list parameter will always have at least

## Practice problem 8

#The game Mancala is one of the oldest games in recorded
#history. You can read more about it here:
#https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-to-play-mancala-409424
#
#For this problem, though, you don't need to know how to
#play the game. All you need to know is the board layout
#and the conditions for winning.
#
#A Mancala board is made of two rows of 6 cups, with two
#bigger cups at the ends. Each cup holds some number of
#stones or chips. For our purposes, though, we'll include
#the bigger cups at the end of the corresponding rows.
#
#So, for us, a Mancala board is represented as a
#2-dimensional list of integers. Each item in the lists
#represents a cup, and the number represents how many
#stones are currently in that cup. For example, this
#could be one board:
#
# [[5, 3, 0, 2, 6, 8, 1],
#  [1, 6, 8, 0, 4, 1, 4]]
#
#With this board representation, the game is over when
#every cup is empty except the top left and the bottom
#right. When the game is over, whoever has more stones
#in their cup wins: if the top left has more stones, the
#top player wins. If the bottom right has more stones,
#the bottom player wins.
#
#Write a function called check_winner. check_winner takes
#as a 2-dimensional list representing a game board. You
#may assume list will always have two lists, each with
#7 items, corresponding to the board structure shown
#above.
#
#Your function should return one of four strings
#depending on the values of the list:
#
# - If the game is not over (that is, there are stones
#   in any bucket except for the top-left or bottom-
#   right), return "Keep playing!"
# - If the game is over and the top player wins (that is,
#   there are more stones in top-left than bottom-right),
#   return "Player 1 wins!"
# - If the game is over and the bottom player wins (that
#   is, there are more stones in the bottom-right than
#   the top-left), return "Player 2 wins!"
# - If the game is over but the score is tied (that is,
#   there is an equal number of stones in the top-left
#   and bottom-right), return "Draw!"

## Practice problem 2

#Write a function called write_streaming_info.
#write_streaming_info will take as input two parameters: a
#string and a list.
#
#The string will represent the filename to which to write.
#
#Each item in the list will be a tuple. The first item of
#every tuple will be the name of a movie. All remaining items
#in the tuple will be streaming services on which the movie
#appears, such as Hulu, Netflix, Peacock, HBO Max, Amazon,
#Disney+, Peacock, YouTube, Crunchyroll, CBS All Access, etc.
#
#write_streaming_info should write the list of movies to the
#file given by the filename using the following format:
#
# [movie]: Available on Service_1, Service_2, and Service_3
#
#The movies and the streaming service names should appear in
#the order of the original list/tuples.
#
#So, for this list of tuples:
#
# [("Chocolat", "Hulu", "Netflix", "Amazon"),
#  ("Skyfall", "HBO Max", "Amazon"),
#  ("Soul", "Disney+")]
#
#The file printed would look like this:
#
# Chocolat: Available on Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon
# Skyfall: Available on HBO Max and Amazon
# Soul: Disney+
#
#Note that if only one service is listed, just that service
#appears after the colon. If two services are listed, they
#appear separated by 'and' with no commas. If three or more
#services are listed, then there is a comma after every
#service except the last one, and the last one is preceded
#by 'and'.

#
#HINT: Remember, you can use slicing on tuples just like strings.
#a_tuple[:2], for example, will give you the first two items in a
#tuple. a_tuple[3:] will give you all the items from the one at
#index 3 to the end.

#the initials of your first and middle name followed by your
#last name. For example, my full name is David Andrew Joyner,
#and therefore my fancy name is D. A. Joyner. But what if you
#have more than one middle name? You initialize those too!
#John Ronald Reuel Tolkien becomes J. R. R. Tolkien. Isla
#Lang Fisher becomes I. L. Fisher; Sasha Baron Cohen becomes
#S. B. Cohen; and their son Montgomery Moses Brian Baron Cohen
#becomes M. M. B. B. Cohen.
#
#Write a function called my_fancy_name. my_fancy_name should
#take as input a single string, comprised of multiple names.
#It should return the "fancy" name: the first initials of the
#first several names followed by a period and space, followed
#by the final last name. It should preserve case; if someone
#has a middle name starting with a lower-case letter, then
#it should be lower-case in their fancy name.


#Write your function below!

    first_initials = ""

## Practice problem 8

#In the classic children's game Swords (also called Odds
#and Evens, Choosies, or Pick), two players simultaneously
#hold out some number of fingers. The winner is determined
#by whether the total number of fingers is odd or even.
#
#For our variant, let us say Player 1 wins if the total
#number of fingers is odd, and Player 2 wins if the total
#number of fingers is even.
#
#Write a function called find_winner. find_winner will take
#as input a list of 2-tuples, each representing a round of
#Swords. Each 2-tuple will contain two integers, each between
#1 and 5. If the sum of the two numbers is odd, then Player
#1 wins the round. If the sum of the two numbers is even,
#then Player 2 wins the round.
#
#find_winner should return the string "Player 1 wins!" if
#Player 1 wins more rounds than Player 2. It should return the
#string "Player 2 wins!" if Player 2 wins more rounds than
#Player 1. It should return the string "It's a tie!" if the
#two players win an equal number of times. 
#
#For example:
#
# find_winner([(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (5, 2)])
#
#...would return "Player 1 wins!" because Player 1 wins
#three rounds and Player 2 wins two rounds. (If you're
#confused: Player 1 wins rounds 2, 3, and 5 because those
#add to 3, 3, and 7; Player 2 wins rounds 1 and 4 because
#those add to 2 and 6).


#Write your function here!
def find_winner(match):
    player1 = 0
    player2 = 0
    for game in match:
        if (game[0] + game[1]) % 2 == 0:
            player2 += 1
        if (game[0] + game[1]) % 2 == 1:
            player1 += 1
    if player1 > player2:
        return "Player 1 wins!"
    if player2 > player1:
        return "Player 2 wins!"
    if player1 == player2:
        return "It's a tie!"
