#let's write functions that will print them.

#First, write two functions: one called print_division_symbol
#and one called print_multiplication_symbol. The functions
#should do what their names suggest: print_division_symbol
#should print a division symbol, print_multiplication_symbol
#should print a multiplication symbol. You can copy the
#characters for those symbols from these directions.
#
#Then, after writing those two functions, call them in the

#print_multiplication_symbol. The output of your code should
#thus be ÷, then ×, each on their own line.

#Note that you don't need to worry about the end="" thing

#Write a function called snowed_in that will determine
#whether school is closed based on the weather and
#temperature. We'll pretend the school is in Georgia, where
#a little snow or sub-freezing temperatures are enough to
#close down schools!
#
#The function should take three parameters:
#
# - temperature, a float
# - weather, a string
# - is_celsius, a boolean
#
#The function should return True if temperature is below
#freezing (32 if is_celsius is False, 0 if is_celsius is
#True) or if weather is "snowy". Otherwise, it should
#return False.
#
#Note, however, that is_celsius should be an optional
#argument. If the function call does not supply a value for
#is_celsius, assume it is True.
#
#For example:
#
# snowed_in(15, "sunny") -> False
# is_celsius is assumed to be True, so 15 is not below
# freezing.
#
# snowed_in(15, "sunny", is_celsius = False) -> True
# is_celsius is False, so 15 is below freezing.
#
# snowed_in(15, "snowy", is_celsius = True) -> True
# The weather is "snowy", so the temperature doesn't matter.

#
#In Bryan Cranston's autobiography, he describes how after
#his success on Breaking Bad, he developed a scoring system
#for evaluating new scripts that he received.
#
#First, he would assign the script a grade -- A, B, C, D, or
#F -- in each of five categories: Story, Text, Role, Director,
#and Cast.
#
#Then, he would tally those grades into a total score for the
#script, according to the following chart:
#
#            A   B   C   D   F
# Story     +6  +5  +4  +2  +0
# Text      +5  +4  +3  +1  +0
# Role      +4  +3  +2  +1  +0
# Director  +3  +2  +1  +0  +0
# Cast/Misc +2  +1  +0  +0  +0
#
#For example: an A story, B text, C role, D directory, and
#F cast would get a score of 12: +6 for the story, +4 for the
#text, +2 for the role, +0 for the director, and +0 for the
#cast.
#
#Then, based on that score, the script would be assigned a
#category (note these are slightly different from the image
#because we've excluded the time variable):
#
# 20: Perfect score
# 17 to 19: Must do
# 14 to 16: Seriously consider
# 12 to 13: On the bubble
# 11 or below: Pass
#
#The variables above give the letter grades assigned to each
#of the five components. Write a program that calculates the
#total score he would assign to the script represented by
#these variables. Then on the next line, print the category
#he would assign to that script. For example, for the values
#above, this program would print:

#On the bubble
#
#HINT: This is a *long* program. It's not particularly
#complex -- you're doing the same thing over and over, However,
#that 'same thing' required 4-8 lines each time you do it. Our

#Diamonds are typically evaluated according to four aspects:
# - Cut: The way the diamond is cut
# - Clarity: How clear or flawless the diamond is, rated
#   as F (the best), IF, VVS, VS, SI, or I (the worst)
# - Color: How colorless the diamond is, rated from "D" (the
#   best) to "Z" (the worst)
# - Carat: How large the diamond is, weighed in carats
#
#Cut is usually a matter of personal preference. Clarity,
#color, and carat are matters of value: the clearer, more
#colorless, and larger a diamond is, the greater its value.
#
#Imagine you're shopping for a diamond. You have your
#preferred cuts, and you have a budget in mind. You're shown
#a diamond whose characteristics are represented by the cut,
#color, clarity, and carat variables above. You'll buy the
#diamond if its cost is less than your budget, and if its
#cut is one of your preferred cuts.
#
#At this store, every diamond has a base cost of 100.
#
#For every color rating worse than "D", the cost decreases by
#2%. An "F" color diamond would be worth 0.96 * the diamond
#cost otherwise because "F" is two colors worse than "D".
#
#A diamond's value is doubled for every level of clarity above
#I. A "VVS"-clarity diamond is worth 8 * the diamond cost
#otherwise because "VVS" is three levels higher than I, and
#doubling its value three times raises its value by 8x total.
#
#After finding its price based on color and clarity, its price
#is multiplied by its weight in carats.
#
#Your program should print "I'll take it!" if you will buy the
#diamond, "No thanks" if you will not. To purchase it, its price
#must be less than your budget and its cut must be one of your
#preferred cuts.
#
#HINT: You can find the number of characters between two
#characters by using the ord() function. ord("E") - ord("D")
#is 1; ord("Z") - ord("D") is 22.

#For example, if mystery_int is 5, this could print:

#2	4	6	8	10
#3	6	9	12	15
#4	8	12	16	20
#5	10	15	20	25
#
#To do this, you'll want to use two nested for loops; the

#parentheses.

#Hint 4: If you're stuck, try first just printing out all

#In chemistry, the ideal gas law states:

#This is usually abbreviated to:

# PV = nRT

#We can solve this for any of these five variables, but let's
#solve it for Pressure. In terms of Pressure, the ideal gas
#law states:

# P = (nRT) / V

#Write a function called find_pressure that takes as input
#three variables: number of moles, temperature, and volume.
#You can call these variables in the function whatever you
#want, but they must be specified in that order: moles, then

#floats. Then, return as output your calculation for
#pressure. For the gas constant, you should use the value 
#0.082057.

#common units of measurement for pressure.
#
#atm is the most common unit for pressure, but there are
#others: mmHg, Torr, Pa, kPa, bar, and mb, for example. what
#if pressure was sent in using one of these units? Our
#calculation would be wrong!

#So, we want to *assume* that pressure is in atm (and thus,

### PRACTICE PROBLEMS ###

## Practice Problem 1

#Imagine you're writing the software that controls the speed
#of a ceiling fan. The user changes the fan's speed by
#pulling a string. Pulling the string increases the fan's =
#speed by 1, unless it's already at the maximum speed. If
#it's already at the maximum speed, it changes the speed
#back to 0.
#
#Write a function called pullString. pullString should take
#two parameters: a current speed, and a maximum speed, both
#integers. pullString should return the new fan speed
#according to the reasoning above.

#You may assume that the input will be integers. You should
#also assume that the fan's speed *can* equal the maximum
#speed, but it *cannot* exceed the maximum speed. You may
#thus assume that you will never be given a currentSpeed
#higher than maxSpeed.

#Write your function here!

def pullString(current_speed, max_speed):
    while current_speed < max_speed:
        current_speed += 1
        return current_speed
    while current_speed == max_speed:
        current_speed = 0
        return current_speed

#The code below will test your function. It isn't used for
#grading, so you can change or remove it if you'd like. As
#written, these three lines should print 3, 5, and 0.
print(pullString(2, 5))
print(pullString(4, 5))
print(pullString(7, 7))


## Practice problem 2

#A common formula in probability and statistics is the
#formula for the number of possible combinations of r
#objects from a set of n objects. For example, the question,
#"How many possible 2-card hands can you deal from a deck of
#52 unique cards?" is saying, "How many combinations of 2
#can you make from a set of 52?"
#
#The formula for the number of combinations of length r from
#a set of n objects is:
#
#  numCombinations = n! / r!(n-r)!
#
#The ! mark is the symbol for factorial. Factorial means the
#product of the number times every number between itself and
#1. For example, 5! is 120: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
#
#Write a function called numCombinations with two parameters:
#n, the number of objects from which to choose, and r, the
#number of objects to choose. numCombinations should return
#the number of combinations according to the formula above.
#Don't worry if you don't fully understand what combinations
#are -- just focus on implementing a function that solves
#that formula given n and r.
#
#You may *not* use Python's built-in factorial method to
#complete this; you should implement that yourself.
#
#Hint: We'd suggest writing two functions: factorial() and
#numCombinations(). Then, call factorial() in your code for 
#numCombinations(). You don't have to do this, but it will
#make your answer a little easier!
#
#Hint 2: Remember to put parentheses around the denominator.

#Write your numCombinations function (and any other functions) 
#here!

#should have three parameters: mass, planet, and gravity.
#planet and gravity should be keyword parameters: by
#default, they should take the values "Earth" (a string) and
#9.807 (a float). However, they should be able to be
#overriden to let us calculate weights on other planets.
#
#The function should return a string that looks like this:
#"A [mass] kg object weighs [weight] Newtons on [planet]."
#You should round the weight to two decimal points. You
#can do this by calling round() on the weight, e.g.
#roundedWeight = round(weight, 2). The 2 dictates how
#many decimal points should be included.
#
#For example:
#
# calculateWeight(10.0) ->
#       "A 10.0 kg object weighs 98.07 Newtons on Earth."
#
# calculateWeight(5.0, planet="Jupiter", gravity=24.79) ->
#       "A 5.0 kg object weighs 24.79 Newtons on Jupiter."
#
#Hint: If you're having trouble with creating the string to
#return, here's the first part:
#result = "A " + str(mass) + " kg object weighs " ...

#Write your function here!
def calculateWeight(mass, planet = "Earth", gravity = 9.807):
    weight = mass * gravity
    weight_rounded = round(weight, 2)
    weight_string = str(weight_rounded)
    return "A " + str(mass) + " kg object weighs " + weight_string + " Newtons on " + planet + "."
    
#The lines of code below will test your function. They are
#not used for grading, so feel free to change them. As
#written, these lines should output the two lines of output
#shown above.

#The Collatz Conjecture is a famous sequence in mathematics
#proposed by Lothar Collatz. It proceeds as follows:
#
#Start with any number. If the number is even, divide it by
#2. If the number is odd, triple it and add one. Repeat.
#Eventually, no matter what number you begin with, this
#sequence will converge on 1 (and if you continue repeating
#it, you'll repeat 1-4-2 infinitely).
#
#For example, imagine we started with the number 21:
#5 is odd, so 5 * 3 + 1 = 16
#16 is even, so 16 / 2 = 8
#8 is even, so 8 / 2 = 4
#4 is even, so 4 / 2 = 2
#2 is even, so 2 / 1 = 1
#
#Starting with 5, this sequence converges on 1 in 5
#iterations: 5 to 16, 16 to 8, 8 to 4, 4 to 2, and 2 to 1.
#
#Implement a function called collatz. collatz should take
#as input an integer, and return the number of iterations
#it takes for the Collatz sequence to reach 1 from that
#number. For example, collatz(5) would return 5 because
#it took 5 iterations to converge on 1.

#Add your code here!

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Imagine you're writing the software for a cash register at a
#retail vendor. The cash register is given a total by the
#cashier (original_total), and must print the total cost for
#the customer, under the following rules:
#
# - There is currently a "$5 off $15" coupon available. If their
#   original total is more than $15 and they have the coupon
#   (has_coupon), they can use this coupon. If their total is
#   below $15, the value of has_coupon doesn't matter.
# - If the customer is a member of the store's discount
#   program (is_member), they receive a 10% discount.
# - Sales tax should be added. Sales tax is the sales_tax_rate
#   multiplied by the original total.
#
#Note that these changes should be applied in this order: first
#the coupon (if available and eligible), then the customer
#discount, then the sales tax.
#
#For example, if original_total is 20, sales tax is 0.10,
#they have a coupon, and they are members, then their total
#would be:
#
#  $20 - $5 = $15 (coupon)
#  $15 - (0.1 * $15) = $13.50 (customer discount)
#  $13.5 + (0.1 * 13.5) = $14.85 (sales tax)
#
#Write some code that prints the total the customer is expected
#to pay, including the dollar sign, rounded to two decimal places
#(don't worry about the trailing 0 for totals like $15.50).
#
#Hint: To round a number, use the round function. For example,
#round(the_num, 2) will round the_num to two decimal places and
#return the result. Round only on the last step; if you round
#after each calculation, your final result may be off by a cent
#or two.

#Add your code here! Make sure to print the dollar sign, too.

## Practice problem 3

#Imagine you're writing the software for a credit card
#processor. This credit card offers 1% cashback to the
#cardholder, which it calculates by deducting 1%
#directly from the original purchase price. The software
#also needs to account for charges made in different
#currencies; these first need to be converted to the
#account's local currency.
#
#Write a function called calculate_charge.
#calculate_charge will have one positional parameter and
#one keyword parameter. The positional parameter will
#represent the original amount of the charge, in whatever
#currency the charge was performed in. The keyword
#parameter will represent the exchange rate between the
#charge's currency and the account's currency; by default,
#it should be 1.0, meaning that the charge took place in
#the account's own currency.
#
#calculate_charge should return the actual charge that
#should appear on the spender's credit card. This would
#be the charge converted to the account's local currency
#(by dividing the charge amount by the exchange rate) and
#deducting 1%. The result should be rounded to two decimal
#places, but not until after all other calculations are
#made.
#
#For example, right now, 1 US Dollar is worth 0.91 Euros.
#A 20 Euro purchase costs $21.98 because 20 / 0.91 = 21.98.
#1% of 21.98 is 0.2198. So, if the function is called with
#an original price of 20.0 and an exchange rate of 0.91,
#it would return 21.76.

#Hint: Remember, you can round a number to two decimal
#places by using the round function. round(the_num, 2) will
#return the_num rounded to two decimal places.

#When x, y, and z are all numbers, this should work just

#
#However, some things might go wrong. The product of x and y
#could be 0, or one of the values could be a string instead of

#Write a function called sort_characters. sort_characters
#should take as input one parameter, a string.

#first, then all the lower-case letters, then all the
#numerals, then all the punctuation marks. Within each
#category, the letters should appear in the same order as
#in the original string.
#
#For example, for the string "DavidJoyner", the function
#would return "DJavidoyner": the capital letters (DJ) first,
#then the lower case, all in the same order in which they
#originally appeared.
#
#Some more examples:

#Write a function that will calculate the Knox index of a

#2. If the number is odd, add one. Repeat. Eventually, no
#matter what number you begin with, this sequence will
#converge on 1. If you continue repeating it, you'll repeat
#1-2-1-2 indefinitely.
#
#For example, imagine we started with the number 50:
#50 is even, so 50 / 2 = 25
#25 is odd, so 25 + 1 = 26
#26 is even, so 26 / 2 = 13
#13 is odd, so 13 + 1 = 14
#14 is even, so 14 / 2 = 7
#7 is odd, so 7 + 1 = 8
#8 is even, so 8 / 2 = 4
#4 is even, so 4 / 2 = 2

#Starting with 50, this sequence converges on 1 in 9

#7, 7 to 8, 8 to 4, 4 to 2, and 2 to 1.
#
#Implement a function called knox. knox should take as
#input an integer, and return the integer's Knox index;
#that is, the number of iterations it takes for the

#B is 11, C is 12, D is 13, E is 14, and F is 15. So, the
#hexadecimal number E is the standard number 14.
#
#Like base 10, hexadecimal has digit places: the ones digit, the
#16s digit, the 256s digit, and the 4096s digit. A 5 in the ones
#spot adds 5 to the total; in the 16s spot it adds 80 to the
#total (5 * 16), in the 256s spot it adds 1280 (5 * 256), and in
#the 4096s spot it adds 20480 (5 * 4096). In 4 digits, base 16
#can represent base 10 numbers up to 65,535 (16^4 - 1).
#
#Write a function called hex_to_decimal. hex_to_decimal will take
#one parameter, a string. You may assume the string will always
#have exactly 4 characters, and that all the characters will be
#a numeral from 0 to 9 or a capital letter from A to F. Return
#result of converting this hexadecimal number to a standard
#base-10 number.


#Add your code here!
