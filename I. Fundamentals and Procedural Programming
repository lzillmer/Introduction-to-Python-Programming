## NOTES

## print(message) - takes as input a message as string and prints it in console
print("Hello, world")

## print(type(myVariable)) - shows data type
myVariable = 5
print(type(myVariable))

## converting between data types, use:
# str(variable)
# int(variable)
# bool(variable) - Python lets you convert anything to a boolean
# float(variable)

myNumber = 5
print(type(myNumber))
myNumberAsString = str(myNumber)
print(type(myNumberAsString)

print("Today's date: " + str(date.today()))
print("Today's date:", date.today()) ## prints the same thing

myIntAsString = "5"
myIntAsInt = int(myIntAsString)
print(myIntAsInt)

## user input
myUserInput = input("Enger an integer: ") ## input will be interpreted as a string
myUserInputAsInt = int(myUserInput)
print(myUserInputAsInt * myUserInputAsInt)

## Python's reserved words
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist) ## shows Python's list of reserved words

# you get a SyntaxError if you try to use a reserved word

## Dot notation
import datetime
currentTime = datetime.datetime.now()
print(currentTime.hour)
print(currentTime.minute)
print(currentTime.second)

## Exercise: print date as year/month/day and time as hour:minute:second
from datetime import date
import datetime
todays_date = date.today()
current_time = datetime.datetime.now()

todays_year_string = str(todays_date.year)
todays_month_string = str(todays_date.month)
todays_day_string = str(todays_date.day)

print(todays_year_string + "/" + todays_month_string + "/" + todays_day_string)

time_hour_string = str(current_time.hour)
time_minute_string = str(current_time.minute)
time_second_string = str(current_time.second)

print(time_hour_string + ":" + time_minute_string + ":" + time_second_string)

## set operators
myString = "hello, world"
print("h" in myString) ## output will be True
print("lo, w" in myString) ## output will be True

## Incrementing and loops
letterCount = 0
for character in "Hello, world":
  letterCount += 1
print(letterCount)    ## counts letters in Hello, world

## Checking if a triangle exists
side1 = int(input("Enter the shortest side: "))
side2 = int(input("Enter the next shortest side: "))
side3 = int(input("Enter the longest side: "))
result = (side1 + side2) > side3
print("'these sides can form a triangle' is, result)


### VARIABLES ###

#Create four variables name my_integer, my_decimal,
#my_string, and my_boolean. Assign to each variable a
#value of the corresponding type (an integer for
#my_integer, a string of characters for my_string,
#etc.). You can choose whatever values you want --
#just make sure the variable names and types are
#correct!
#
#Then, print the types of each of the four variables
#in order: first the integer, then the decimal
#number, then the string, then the boolean. This
#should print text like <class 'int'>, <class
#'float'>, and so on.
#
#Don't print anything except their types!


#Create your variables here!
my_integer = 5
my_decimal = 1.2

#Now, add three lines of code that will print the values

### LOGICAL OPERATORS ###

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Remember, greater than and less than operators can be used to
#compare strings. A string is "less than" another string if it
#comes earlier when sorted alphabetically.
#
#This can have some nuances, though, when it comes to
#capitalization, punctuation, and spaces.
#
#Write some code below that will print True if mystery_string_1
#comes before mystery_string_2 alphabetically according to
#Python, and False if it does not.
#
#While this might be a simple line of code, we'd strongly
#recommend checking out the submission results to see some of
#the odd ways that Python performs. For example, don't be
#surprised when your code says that it's True that "Grapes"
#comes before "apples" alphabetically: Python puts all
#upper-case letters before all lower-case letters.


#Write your code here!
mystery_string_1 = mystery_string_1.lower()
mystery_string_2 = mystery_string_2.lower()

print(mystery_string_1 < mystery_string_2)

###

mystery_string = "Hello, world!"

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#The 'in' operator can be used to see if a string of characters
#is found within another string of characters, just like it can
#be used to find if an item is in a list.
#
#Above we've created a string with the variable name
#mystery_string. Write some code below that will print True
#if the string "world" appears within mystery_string, and
#False if it does not.

#credit card processor. We want to approve a purchase if the
#customer's balance is greater than or equal to the purchase
#price, and reject it otherwise.
#
#Write some code below that will print True if balance is
#greater than or equal to price, and False if it is not.


#Add your code here!

#Last exercise, we printed True if balance was greater than or
#equal to price, and False otherwise. However, some banks have
#something called overdraft protection. Overdraft protection
#means that the customer is allowed to spend more than their
#balance, and the bank just expects them to deposit the money
#to cover the purchase later.
#
#Write some code below that will print True if the customer
#can make the purchase given their balance, the purchase
#price, and whether or not they have overdraft protection.
#Specifically, the result should be True if balance is greater
#than or equal to price or if overdraft_protection is True,
#and False if neither of these are true.

# - boots, if it's cold and snowy.
# - flip flops, if it's hot, unless it's rainy.
# - a t-shirt, if it's hot, unless it's rainy or windy.

#Write some code below that will print four lines, one for
#each of the four types of clothing. Under the original
#values for the variables above, the lines should look
#like this:
#
#Jacket: False
#Boots: False
#Flip-Flops: False
#T-shirt: False
#
#The values (True and False) will differ based on the
#values assigned to hot, cold, windy, snowy, and rainy
#at the start of the program.
#
#Hint: To print these lines, you'll need to add the
#result of the expression to a string of the clothing item.
#To do that, we'll need to convert the boolean from the
#expression into a string.

#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#The variables above create a dividend and a divisor. Add
#some code below that will print the quotient and remainder
#of performing this operation. The quotient should be the
#whole number, not the decimal number: for example, with the
#original values of dividend and divisor (7 and 3), your code
#should print 2, then 1: 3 goes into 7 two whole times, with
#one left over.
#
#Print the quotient and remainder each on their own line.
#Both values should be integers: there should be no decimals.

#The Arrhenius equation is a formula used in physical
#chemsitry to show temperature dependence on reaction rates.
#A modified form of the equation is showed below:
#
# k = A x T^n x e^(-Ea/(R x T))
#
#Where k is a rate constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin,
#n is some constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is
#the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant, and
#e is the mathematical constant.

#Below, write some lines of code that replicates this modified
#Arrhenius equation using the variables created above as the

#value of k. For the mathematical constant e, we have imported
#e from the math library so you can simply use e to access this
#value (as if it's a variable defined above as well).
#
#You should round the result to two decimal places. To do this,

#the following syntax:
#
#rounded_num = round(original_num, 2)

#parts of the dates and times. You can access the hour,
#minute, and seconds from start_time with start_time.hour,
#start_time.minute, and start_time.second. You can access
#the year, month, and day of start_date with
#start_date.year, start_date.month, and start_date.day. You
#can use the same syntax to access the parts of end_date.
#Note that Python uses 24-hour time.
#
#Hint: You may use conditionals to solve this if you want,
#but you don't need to.
#
#Hint 2: You can use relational operators with both dates
#and times. start_time < end_time is True if start_time is
#before end_time. start_date >= end_date is True if
#start_date is later than end_date, or the same date. With
#this, you can avoid using dot notation altogether if
#you'd like.

#Add your code here!
print(end_date >= start_date and end_time > start_time)


## Practice problem 5

goal = 50000
rate = 0.05
years = 5

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Earlier, we created a program that would calculate the
#value of an investment account after a certain period of
#time using the formula Amount = Principal * e^(Rate * Time).
#
#Let's revisit that, but let's flip the question around.
#Instead of asking, "What will the value of this account
#be?", let's instead ask, "How much do I need to invest to
#have a certain amount by a certain year?" For example,
#"How much do I need to invest to have $50,000 in 5 years
#at 5% (0.05) interest?"
#
#Mathematically, the formula for this is:
#
#  goal / e ^ (rate * number of years) = principal
#
#Add some code below that will print the amount of principal
#needed to reach the given savings goal within the number of
#years and interest rate specified.
#
#In printing your response, you should round the answer to
#two decimal places. Remember, you can do this with this
#code (assuming that your principal is stored in a variable
#called 'principal'): rounded_principal = round(principal, 2)
#
#Remember, you can access e using math.e as long as you don't
#change the next line.
import math

#Add your code here!
principal = goal / math.e ** (rate * years)
rounded_principal = round(principal, 2)

## Practice problem 6

principal = 40000
rate = 0.05
years = 5
goal = 50000

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Last problem, we calculated how much money a person would
#have to invest to reach a certain savings goal. Now, let's
#modify that to instead take a principal, interest rate,
#number of years, and savings goal, and report whether or not
#the person will meet their savings goal.
#
#Add some code below that will calculate whether the
#investment described by the values above will meet the given
#goal. If it will, print True. If it will not, print False.
#
#As a reminder, the formula for the value of an account after
#a given time (in number of years) is:
#
#  Current Value = principal * e ^ (rate * number of years)
#
#Remember, you can access e using math.e as long as you don't
#change the next line. You don't need to worry about rounding
#on this problem.

#You may assume that the largest bill you have on hand is a
#$50-dollar bill.
#
#Your code should print the following (with the correct numbers

cost = 150000
rate = 0.0415
years = 15

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#When taking out a mortgage (a type of loan) for a house, the
#mortgage is defined by three variables: the total cost of the
#house, the interest rate at which you will pay back the
#mortgage, and how many months you have to pay back the
#mortgage.
#
#The formula to find the total amount of money that will be
#paid over that time is:
#
#  Cost * Number of Months * Monthly Rate /
#  (1 - ((1 + Monthly Rate) ^ -Number of Months))
#
#Note that both time and rate are based on months: to find the
#monhtly rate, divide the annual rate by 12. To find the number
#of months, multiply the number of years by 12.
#
#Write some code that prints out a sentence like the following
#based on the original cost, interest rate, and number of years
#given above:
#
# The total cost of the house will be $201751.36
#
#You should round the total cost to two decimal places. You can
#do this with this line, assuming the actual value of the
#mortgage is stored in final_cost: final_cost = round(final_cost, 2)


#Add your code here!

## Problem 5

number = 215

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.
#
#The number above is given in base 10. Let's convert it to
#base 2 and print it in binary. For example, 215 can be written
#in binary as 11010111.
#
#Each digit of that string corresponds to a power of 2. The far
#left digit represents 128, then 64, then 32, then 16, then 8,
#then 4, then 2, and then finally 1 at the far right.
#
#To convert the number to binary, first check to see if it is
#greater than or equal to 128. If it is, your first digit is 1.
#If not, your first digit is 0. If the number was greater than
#128, subtract 128 (because the 128 is captured by the first
#digit of the string).
#
#Then, repeat that process for 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1.
#
#For example:
#
#215 is >= 128: 1
#87 is >= 64: 11
#23 is not >= 32: 110
#23 is >= 16: 1101
#7 is not >= 8: 11010
#7 is >= 4: 110101
#3 is >= 2: 1101011
#1 is >= 1: 11010111
#
#Note that although we use 'if' a lot to describe this problem,
#this can be done entirely with floor division and modulus.
#Remember, if you convert a boolean to an integer, True becomes
#1 and False becomes 0.
#
#Note that we always work with binary in 8-bit chunks: the
#number 7 would be 00000111, not just 111. That's because inside
#the computer, 8 1s and 0s make a byte, which is the smallest
#practical unit of storage (rarely are bits used outside 8-bit
#bytes).
#
#Print the string that results from this conversion.

#Add your code here!

## Problem 7

num = 4

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to

#Write some code that calculates the square and the square root
#of the number given above. Then, it should print the root the
#square number of times. If the square root is a decimal,
#round it down (you can do this by converting the decimal to
#an integer: Python will automatically round it down).
#
#For example, if num is 4, then your code would print:
#
# 2222222222222222
#
#That's 2 16 times. 4 squared is 16, the square root of 4 is 2,
#and so it prints 2 16 times.
#
#For another example: if num is 13, then 13 squared is 169, and
#the square root of 13 is ~3.6. 3.6 rounds down to 3. So, it would
#print 3 169 times.

# Problem 5
number = 1101

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!

#
#The number above represents a binary number. It will always

#either 1 or 0.
#
#The string gives the binary representation of a number. In

#So, to convert the number to a decimal number, you want to (for
#example) add 128 to the total if the first digit is 1, 64 if the
#second digit is 1, 32 if the third digit is 1, etc.
#
#For example, 00001101 is the number 13: there is a 0 in the 128s
#place, 64s place, 32s place, 16s place, and 2s place. There are
#1s in the 8s, 4s, and 1s place. 8 + 4 + 1 = 13.

#of the number given above. Then, it should print the square the
#square root number of times. If the square root is a decimal,
#round it down (you can do this by converting the decimal to
#an integer: Python will automatically round it down).
#
#For example, if num is 4, then your code would print:
#
# 1616
#
#That's 16 2 times. 4 squared is 16, the square root of 4 is 2,
#and so it prints 16 2 times.
#
#For another example: if num is 13, then 13 squared is 169, and
#the square root of 13 is ~3.6. 3.6 rounds down to 3. So, it would
#print: 169169169, or 169 3 times.

#Add your code here!
sq = num ** 2
sqrt = num ** 0.5
sqrt_round = int(sqrt)
print((str(sq)) * sqrt_round)


## PROBLEM SET 3

## Problem 1

original_total = "5.45"
donation = "0.55"

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Imagine you're writing code for the cash register of a
#fast casual restaurant. For this restaurant, customers have
#the option to round up their total and donate the extra to
#charity. For example, if a customer's total was $5.45, they
#could round up to $6.00, and donate the extra $0.55 to
#charity.
#
#The variables original_total and donation represent these
#values; you may assume they will always add to a whole integer.
#Due to an error by another programmer, though, they are initially
#given to you as strings rather than floats.
#
#Write some code that will print the customer's total and
#how much they donated. This sentence should read as follows:
#
# Your total is $6 and you donated $0.55
#
#Note that because we always round up to a full dollar,
#the total should be printed as an integer. Make sure the
#dollar signs are in the right place, with no spaces following
#the dollar signs.

#Add your code here!
original_total_float = float(original_total)
donation_float = float(donation)
total_int = int(original_total_float + donation_float)

print("Your total is $" + str(total_int) + " and you donated $" + donation)


## Problem 2

is_weekend = True
is_holiday = False
is_rainy = False

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Write a program that will determine what kind of plans you
#could make based on what kind of day it is and what the
#weather is like.
#
#You have three variables to use in these decisions:
#
# - is_weekend, whether it's a weekend day
# - is_holiday, whether it's a holiday
# - is_rainy, whether it's going to be raining
#
#Your four options are:
#
# - Beach, if it's both a holiday and a weekend as long as
#   it's _not_ raining. If it's raining, the beach is not
#   an option.
# - Lake, if it's a weekend and not raining. It doesn't
#   matter if it's a holiday or not.
# - Park, if it's not raining. It doesn't matter whether
#   it's a weekend or holiday.
# - Home, if it's raining, or if it's neither a weekend
#   nor a holiday.
#
#In other words: the Beach is an option on holiday weekends
#when the weather is good. The Lake is an option on regular
#weekends when the weather is good. The Park is an option
#any time the weather is good. Home is an option if it's
#raining, or if it's not a weekday that isn't a holiday.

#
#Print your results like this, based on whether each is
#an option according to the logic above:
#
# - Beach: False
# - Lake: True
# - Park: True
# - Home: False

#Add your code here!
print("Beach:", is_holiday and is_weekend and not is_rainy) 
print("Lake:", is_weekend and not is_rainy)
print("Park:", not is_rainy)
print("Home:", is_rainy or not (is_weekend or is_holiday))


## Problem 3

assignment_num = 1
day = "Friday"
month = "September"
date = 13
time = "5PM"

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#At the beginning of each week, we try to post an announcement
#outlining everything you need to do during the week. Let's
#see if we could parameterize that.
#
#The variables above -- assignment_num, day, month, date, and
#time -- give various values about when an assignment is due.
#Using these values you should print a sentence like this:
#
# You should submit Assignment 1 by Friday, September 13 at 5PM.
#
#The general form would be:
# You should submit Assignment [assignment_num] by [day], [month] [date] at [time].
#
#Make sure the punctuation and spaces are all exactly as written.
#There should be spaces before and after the assignment number,
#a comma and space after the day of the week, and a period
#after the time.

#Add your code here!

## Problem 4

value = 100
quantity = 5
interest = 0.02
dividend = 1.05
dividend_frequency = 4
years = 10
goal = 250

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Typically when you purchase a stock on the stock market, you
#do so with the hope that it will increase in value, and you
#can then sell it for a profit.
#
#Some stocks also pay dividends. A dividend is a small amount
#of money that a stock pays its owners on a regular interval.
#For example, if a stock pays a $1.05 dividend 4 times a year,
#then for each share of the stock you own, you would receive
#$4.20 per year.
#
#The variables above give a number of parameters for a
#particular stock purchase you are considering:
#
# - value, the current value of the stock
# - quantity, the number of shares you may buy
# - interest, the estimated yearly interest rate it will earn
# - dividend, the predicted value of the dividend it will pay
# - dividend_frequency, the predicted frequency with which it
#   will pay that dividend
# - years, the number of years you plan to hold the stock
# - goal, the amount of money you want to earn from the
#   investment
#
#Your goal is to print True if this investment will meet your
#savings goal, and False if it will not. In other words, if
#the total amount of money you will earn from the stock --
#including its initial value, interest, and dividends -- is
#greater than goal, you print True. Otherwise, you print False.
#
#You can find the total amount of money generated by dividends
#by multiplying the dividend by its yearly frequency by the
#number of years.
#
#The formula for the current value of an investment based on
#its initial value, its interest rate, and its years of investment
#is:
#
# new value = initial value * e ^ (interest rate * number of years)
#
#The variable interest can be put directly into this formula (you
#do not need to add 1). The following line of code will let you use
#the variable e in your code for e:
from math import e

#Remember, your only goal is to print True if you should buy the
#stock, False if you should not. Using the initial values of the
#variables above, this would initially print False: the total
#value would be around $164, well short of the goal of $250.

#Add your code here!
dividend = dividend * dividend_frequency * years
print(goal <= value * e ** (interest * years) + dividend)


## Problem 5
donuts = 119

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#A donut shop sells donuts in four sizes: packs of 60 donuts,
#packs of 12 donuts, packs of 3 donuts, and individual donuts.
#
#To divide donuts into packs, they start by making as many of
#the largest pack as they can. Then, they make as many of the
#next largest pack, then the next pack, then finally they sell
#the remaining donuts individually. For example, if they baked
#119 donuts, then they would divide those donuts into one
#pack of 60, four packs of 12, three packs of 3, and 2
#individual donuts.
#
#Based on the variable donuts above, calculate how many of
#each size they will make. Print the results according to
#this template:
#
#Packs of 60: 1
#Packs of 12: 4
#Packs of 3: 3
#Packs of 1: 2

#Add your code here!
print("Packs of 60:", donuts//60)
remainder = donuts - 60*(donuts//60)

print("Packs of 12:", remainder//12)
remainder = remainder - 12*(remainder//12)

print("Packs of 3:", remainder//3)
remainder = remainder - 3*(remainder//3)

remainder = remainder - 1*(remainder//1)

#It's been said that the most confusing WiFi password you can
#have is: 2444666668888888, because you can read it as: one 2,
#three 4s, five 6s, seven 8s. Whisper the 's' and the listener
#will think it's just 12345678.
#
#Write a program that will generate a bad password according to
#a similar formula. Specifically, the variables above -- num_a,
#num_b, num_c, num_d, and num_e -- give you 5 integers. Your
#password should be: num_a num_b times, num_b num_c times,
#num_c num_d times, num_d num_e times, and num_e num_a times, in
#that order. Then, the entire password should repeat num_z times.
#
#So, for the initial values of num_a through num_e, this would
#be:
#
# 112223333444445112223333444445112223333444445
#
#That is, 1 two times, 2 three times, 3 four times, 4 five times,
#and 5 one time, all then repeated 3 times.
#
#You may assume all numbers will be between 0 and 9. Note, though,
#that if a number is 0, that means the preceding number will
#not actually appear. Moreover, if num_z is 0, the result string
#should be empty.

#Add your code below!

#card you put down must meet one of two conditions:
#
# - It must either have the same color _or_ the same value
#   as the previous card, or
# - It must be black. Black cards (Wild and Wild Draw 4) may
#   be played at any time, no matter the value of the previous
#   card.
#
#Write some code that prints True if the card represented by
#current_color and current_value may be played on top of the
#card represented by previous_color and previous_value. Print
#False if it may not be played.
