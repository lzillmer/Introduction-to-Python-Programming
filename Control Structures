#When writing out mathematical equations for younger

#asterisks. These keys aren't on the keyboard, though. So,
#let's write functions that will print them.
#
#First, write two functions: one called print_division_symbol
#and one called print_multiplication_symbol. The functions
#should do what their names suggest: print_division_symbol
#should print a division symbol, print_multiplication_symbol
#should print a multiplication symbol. You can copy the
#characters for those symbols from these directions.
#
#Then, after writing those two functions, call them in the
#same order: print_division_symbol, then
#print_multiplication_symbol. The output of your code should
#thus be ÷, then ×, each on their own line.
#
#Note that you don't need to worry about the end="" thing
#you saw in the video: just print the symbols on their own
#lines. Note also that if you receive a UnicodeEncodeError,
#try submitting your code instead of running it: that error

#Write a function called snowed_in that will determine

#The function should return True if temperature is below
#freezing (32 if is_celsius is False, 0 if is_celsius is
#True) or if weather is "snowy". Otherwise, it should

#Note, however, that is_celsius should be an optional
#argument. If the function call does not supply a value for
#is_celsius, assume it is True.

### PRACTICE PROBLEMS ###

## Practice Problem 1

#Imagine you're writing the software that controls the speed
#of a ceiling fan. The user changes the fan's speed by
#pulling a string. Pulling the string increases the fan's =
#speed by 1, unless it's already at the maximum speed. If
#it's already at the maximum speed, it changes the speed
#back to 0.
#
#Write a function called pullString. pullString should take
#two parameters: a current speed, and a maximum speed, both
#integers. pullString should return the new fan speed
#according to the reasoning above.

#You may assume that the input will be integers. You should
#also assume that the fan's speed *can* equal the maximum
#speed, but it *cannot* exceed the maximum speed. You may
#thus assume that you will never be given a currentSpeed
#higher than maxSpeed.

#Write your function here!

def pullString(current_speed, max_speed):
    while current_speed < max_speed:
        current_speed += 1
        return current_speed
    while current_speed == max_speed:
        current_speed = 0
        return current_speed

#The code below will test your function. It isn't used for

#written, these three lines should print 3, 5, and 0.
print(pullString(2, 5))
print(pullString(4, 5))

## Practice problem 2

#A common formula in probability and statistics is the
#formula for the number of possible combinations of r
#objects from a set of n objects. For example, the question,
#"How many possible 2-card hands can you deal from a deck of
#52 unique cards?" is saying, "How many combinations of 2
#can you make from a set of 52?"
#
#The formula for the number of combinations of length r from
#a set of n objects is:
#
#  numCombinations = n! / r!(n-r)!
#
#The ! mark is the symbol for factorial. Factorial means the
#product of the number times every number between itself and
#1. For example, 5! is 120: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
#
#Write a function called numCombinations with two parameters:
#n, the number of objects from which to choose, and r, the
#number of objects to choose. numCombinations should return
#the number of combinations according to the formula above.
#Don't worry if you don't fully understand what combinations
#are -- just focus on implementing a function that solves
#that formula given n and r.
#
#You may *not* use Python's built-in factorial method to
#complete this; you should implement that yourself.
#
#Hint: We'd suggest writing two functions: factorial() and
#numCombinations(). Then, call factorial() in your code for 
#numCombinations(). You don't have to do this, but it will
#make your answer a little easier!
#
#Hint 2: Remember to put parentheses around the denominator.

#Write your numCombinations function (and any other functions) 
#here!

def factorial(num1):
    factorial = 1
    for i in range (1, num1 + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial

def numCombinations(n, r):
    return factorial(n) / (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))

#The lines below will test your code. They are not used for
#grading, so feel free to modify them. As written, they should
#print: 1326.0, 252.0, and 4.0, each on their own line.

## Practice problem 3

#An object's weight is defined as its mass times the gravity
#on the planet where it sits. We tend to assume that the
#planet is earth and its gravity is 9.807 m/s^2. However,
#sometimes we might want to calculate an object's weight on
#a different planet.
#
#Write a function called calculateWeight. calculateWeight
#should have three parameters: mass, planet, and gravity.
#planet and gravity should be keyword parameters: by
#default, they should take the values "Earth" (a string) and
#9.807 (a float). However, they should be able to be
#overriden to let us calculate weights on other planets.
#
#The function should return a string that looks like this:
#"A [mass] kg object weighs [weight] Newtons on [planet]."
#You should round the weight to two decimal points. You
#can do this by calling round() on the weight, e.g.
#roundedWeight = round(weight, 2). The 2 dictates how
#many decimal points should be included.
#
#For example:
#
# calculateWeight(10.0) ->
#       "A 10.0 kg object weighs 98.07 Newtons on Earth."
#
# calculateWeight(5.0, planet="Jupiter", gravity=24.79) ->
#       "A 5.0 kg object weighs 24.79 Newtons on Jupiter."
#
#Hint: If you're having trouble with creating the string to
#return, here's the first part:
#result = "A " + str(mass) + " kg object weighs " ...

#Write your function here!
def calculateWeight(mass, planet = "Earth", gravity = 9.807):
    weight = mass * gravity
    weight_rounded = round(weight, 2)
    weight_string = str(weight_rounded)
    return "A " + str(mass) + " kg object weighs " + weight_string + " Newtons on " + planet + "."
    
#The lines of code below will test your function. They are
#not used for grading, so feel free to change them. As
#written, these lines should output the two lines of output
#shown above.

#The Joyner Conjecture proceeds as follows:
#
#Start with any number. If the number is divisible by 3,
#divide it by 3. Otherwise, add 2 to the number. Eventually,
#no matter what number you begin with, this series will run
#into 1 or 2. If it runs into 1, it will repeat 1-3 forever.
#If it runs into 2, it will repeat 2-4-6 forever.
#
#For example, imagine we started with the number 5:
#5 is not divisible by 3, so 5 + 2 = 7
#7 is not divisible by 3, so 7 + 2 = 9
#9 is divisible by 3, so 9 / 3 = 3
#3 is divisible by 3, so 3 / 3 = 1
#
#Start with 5, this sequence converges on 1 in 4 iterations:
#5 -> 7, 7 -> 9, 9 -> 3, 3 -> 1.
#
#Write a function called joyner. joyner should have one
#parameter, an integer. It should return the number of
#iterations required to reach either 1 or 2 for the first
#time.

#Add your code here!    

def joyner(number):
    count = 0
    while number != 1 and number != 2:
        if number % 3 == 0:
            number /= 3
            count += 1
        else:
            number += 2
            count += 1
    return count

#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: 4, 5, and 10, each on their own lines.
print(joyner(5))
print(joyner(15))
print(joyner(29))


## Practice problem 9

#Imagine you're writing the software for an inventory system for
#a store. Part of the software needs to check to see if inputted
#product codes are valid.
#
#A product code is valid if all of the following conditions are
#true:
#
# - The length of the product code is a multiple of 4. It could
#   be 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, etc. characters long.
# - Every character in the product code is either an uppercase
#   character or a numeral. No lowercase letters or punctuation
#   marks are permitted.
# - The character sequence "A1" appears somewhere in the
#   product code.
#
#Write a function called valid_product_code. valid_product_code
#should have one parameter, a string. It should return True if
#the string is a valid product code, and False if it is not.

#Add your code here!
def valid_product_code(string):
    if len(string) % 4 != 0:
        return False
    for character in string:
        if not (character.isupper() or character.isdigit()):
            return False
    if "A1" not in string:
        return False
    else:
        return True

print(valid_product_code("A12B44BP"))
print(valid_product_code("BFDSAUSA98932RWEFOEWA9FEAA1DSFSF"))
print(valid_product_code("A1BBD5"))
print(valid_product_code("BDD5664S"))
print(valid_product_code("66aBSaA1fdsv"))
