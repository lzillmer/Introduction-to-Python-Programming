#let's write functions that will print them.

#First, write two functions: one called print_division_symbol
#and one called print_multiplication_symbol. The functions
#should do what their names suggest: print_division_symbol
#should print a division symbol, print_multiplication_symbol
#should print a multiplication symbol. You can copy the
#characters for those symbols from these directions.
#
#Then, after writing those two functions, call them in the

#print_multiplication_symbol. The output of your code should
#thus be ÷, then ×, each on their own line.

#Note that you don't need to worry about the end="" thing

### PRACTICE PROBLEMS ###

## Practice Problem 1

#Imagine you're writing the software that controls the speed
#of a ceiling fan. The user changes the fan's speed by
#pulling a string. Pulling the string increases the fan's =
#speed by 1, unless it's already at the maximum speed. If
#it's already at the maximum speed, it changes the speed
#back to 0.
#
#Write a function called pullString. pullString should take
#two parameters: a current speed, and a maximum speed, both
#integers. pullString should return the new fan speed
#according to the reasoning above.

#You may assume that the input will be integers. You should
#also assume that the fan's speed *can* equal the maximum
#speed, but it *cannot* exceed the maximum speed. You may
#thus assume that you will never be given a currentSpeed
#higher than maxSpeed.

#Write your function here!

def pullString(current_speed, max_speed):
    while current_speed < max_speed:
        current_speed += 1
        return current_speed
    while current_speed == max_speed:
        current_speed = 0
        return current_speed

#The code below will test your function. It isn't used for

#written, these three lines should print 3, 5, and 0.

## Practice problem 2

#A common formula in probability and statistics is the
#formula for the number of possible combinations of r
#objects from a set of n objects. For example, the question,
#"How many possible 2-card hands can you deal from a deck of
#52 unique cards?" is saying, "How many combinations of 2
#can you make from a set of 52?"
#
#The formula for the number of combinations of length r from
#a set of n objects is:
#
#  numCombinations = n! / r!(n-r)!
#
#The ! mark is the symbol for factorial. Factorial means the
#product of the number times every number between itself and
#1. For example, 5! is 120: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
#
#Write a function called numCombinations with two parameters:
#n, the number of objects from which to choose, and r, the
#number of objects to choose. numCombinations should return
#the number of combinations according to the formula above.
#Don't worry if you don't fully understand what combinations
#are -- just focus on implementing a function that solves
#that formula given n and r.
#
#You may *not* use Python's built-in factorial method to
#complete this; you should implement that yourself.
#
#Hint: We'd suggest writing two functions: factorial() and
#numCombinations(). Then, call factorial() in your code for 
#numCombinations(). You don't have to do this, but it will
#make your answer a little easier!
#
#Hint 2: Remember to put parentheses around the denominator.

#Write your numCombinations function (and any other functions) 
#here!

def factorial(num1):
    factorial = 1
    for i in range (1, num1 + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial

def numCombinations(n, r):
    return factorial(n) / (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))

#The lines below will test your code. They are not used for

## Practice problem 3

#An object's weight is defined as its mass times the gravity
#on the planet where it sits. We tend to assume that the
#planet is earth and its gravity is 9.807 m/s^2. However,
#sometimes we might want to calculate an object's weight on
#a different planet.
#
#Write a function called calculateWeight. calculateWeight
#should have three parameters: mass, planet, and gravity.
#planet and gravity should be keyword parameters: by
#default, they should take the values "Earth" (a string) and
#9.807 (a float). However, they should be able to be
#overriden to let us calculate weights on other planets.
#
#The function should return a string that looks like this:
#"A [mass] kg object weighs [weight] Newtons on [planet]."
#You should round the weight to two decimal points. You
#can do this by calling round() on the weight, e.g.
#roundedWeight = round(weight, 2). The 2 dictates how
#many decimal points should be included.
#
#For example:
#
# calculateWeight(10.0) ->
#       "A 10.0 kg object weighs 98.07 Newtons on Earth."
#
# calculateWeight(5.0, planet="Jupiter", gravity=24.79) ->
#       "A 5.0 kg object weighs 24.79 Newtons on Jupiter."
#
#Hint: If you're having trouble with creating the string to
#return, here's the first part:
#result = "A " + str(mass) + " kg object weighs " ...

#Write your function here!
def calculateWeight(mass, planet = "Earth", gravity = 9.807):
    weight = mass * gravity
    weight_rounded = round(weight, 2)
    weight_string = str(weight_rounded)
    return "A " + str(mass) + " kg object weighs " + weight_string + " Newtons on " + planet + "."
    
#The lines of code below will test your function. They are
#not used for grading, so feel free to change them. As
#written, these lines should output the two lines of output
#shown above.

#Start with any number. If the number is divisible by 3,
#divide it by 3. Otherwise, add 2 to the number. Eventually,
#no matter what number you begin with, this series will run
#into 1 or 2. If it runs into 1, it will repeat 1-3 forever.
#If it runs into 2, it will repeat 2-4-6 forever.
#
#For example, imagine we started with the number 5:
#5 is not divisible by 3, so 5 + 2 = 7
#7 is not divisible by 3, so 7 + 2 = 9
#9 is divisible by 3, so 9 / 3 = 3
#3 is divisible by 3, so 3 / 3 = 1
#
#Start with 5, this sequence converges on 1 in 4 iterations:
#5 -> 7, 7 -> 9, 9 -> 3, 3 -> 1.
#
#Write a function called joyner. joyner should have one
#parameter, an integer. It should return the number of
#iterations required to reach either 1 or 2 for the first
#time.

#Add your code here!

#Start with any number. If the number is even, divide it by
#2. If the number is odd, triple it and add one. Repeat.
#Eventually, no matter what number you begin with, this
#sequence will converge on 1 (and if you continue repeating
#it, you'll repeat 1-4-2 infinitely).
#
#For example, imagine we started with the number 21:
#5 is odd, so 5 * 3 + 1 = 16
#16 is even, so 16 / 2 = 8
#8 is even, so 8 / 2 = 4

#

#as input an integer, and return the number of iterations

#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to

#Imagine you're writing the software for a cash register at a
#retail vendor. The cash register is given a total by the
#cashier (original_total), and must print the total cost for
#the customer, under the following rules:
#
# - There is currently a "$5 off $15" coupon available. If their
#   original total is more than $15 and they have the coupon
#   (has_coupon), they can use this coupon. If their total is
#   below $15, the value of has_coupon doesn't matter.
# - If the customer is a member of the store's discount
#   program (is_member), they receive a 10% discount.
# - Sales tax should be added. Sales tax is the sales_tax_rate
#   multiplied by the original total.
#
#Note that these changes should be applied in this order: first
#the coupon (if available and eligible), then the customer
#discount, then the sales tax.
#
#For example, if original_total is 20, sales tax is 0.10,
#they have a coupon, and they are members, then their total
#would be:
#
#  $20 - $5 = $15 (coupon)
#  $15 - (0.1 * $15) = $13.50 (customer discount)
#  $13.5 + (0.1 * 13.5) = $14.85 (sales tax)
#
#Write some code that prints the total the customer is expected
#to pay, including the dollar sign, rounded to two decimal places
#(don't worry about the trailing 0 for totals like $15.50).
#
#Hint: To round a number, use the round function. For example,
#round(the_num, 2) will round the_num to two decimal places and
#return the result. Round only on the last step; if you round
#after each calculation, your final result may be off by a cent
#or two.

## Practice problem 4

x = 10
y = 5
z = 2

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.
#
#Implement and print out the results of the formula below,
#rounded to two decimal places:
#
# z / (x * y)
#
#When x, y, and z are all numbers, this should work just
#fine: for example, for x = 10, y = 5, and z = 2, this would
#print out 0.04: 2 / (10 * 5) = 0.04.
#
#However, some things might go wrong. The product of x and y
#could be 0, or one of the values could be a string instead of
#a number.
#
#If a divide-by-zero error occurs instead, print the message:
#"Can't divide by zero!" (without the quotation marks).
#
#If one of the values ends up being a string, print the message:
#"Can't divide by a string!" (without the quotation marks).
#
#No matter what happens, your code should print "Done!" (without
#quotation marks) at the end.
#
#Note that you may not use any conditionals in your answer.
#Note also that you should not assume that every error that
#occurs is a divide-by-zero error: any other errors should
#not be caught.

#Add your code here!

## Practice problem 6

#Write a function called sort_characters. sort_characters
#should take as input one parameter, a string.
#
#sort_characters should return a string such that all the
#characters in the original string are still present, but
#in a different order. All the capital letters should appear
#first, then all the lower-case letters, then all the
#numerals, then all the punctuation marks. Within each
#category, the letters should appear in the same order as
#in the original string.
#
#For example, for the string "DavidJoyner", the function
#would return "DJavidoyner": the capital letters (DJ) first,
#then the lower case, all in the same order in which they
#originally appeared.
#
#Some more examples:
#
# sort_characters("GeorgiaTech") -> "GTeorgiaech"
# sort_characters("ThisIsCS1301!") -> "TICShiss1301!"
# sort_characters("One1.Two2?Three3!") -> "OTTnewohree123.?!"
# sort_characters("CS1301") -> "CS1301"
#
#You may use the ord() function to get a letter's ordinal
#number. The ordinal numbers you might need to use are:
#
# - Capital letters: 65 ("A") through 90 ("Z").
# - Lower-case letters: 97 ("a") through 122 ("z").
# - Numerals: 48 ("0") through 57 ("9").
# - Punctuation: Any other ordinals (for this problem).
#
#Hint: You don't have to use ordinal numbers; you can use the
#in operator instead, e.g. "a" in "abcde".
#
#Hint 2: If you're stuck, think of this problem in two stages:
#dividing the characters into their categories, and then
#recombining them into their results!

#Write your function here!

## Practice problem 7

#Write a function that will calculate the Knox index of a
#number. The Knox Index is a thing I made up for this
#problem, and it is defined as follows:
#
#Start with the number. If the number is even, divide it by
#2. If the number is odd, add one. Repeat. Eventually, no
#matter what number you begin with, this sequence will
#converge on 1. If you continue repeating it, you'll repeat
#1-2-1-2 indefinitely.
#
#For example, imagine we started with the number 50:
#50 is even, so 50 / 2 = 25
#25 is odd, so 25 + 1 = 26
#26 is even, so 26 / 2 = 13
#13 is odd, so 13 + 1 = 14
#14 is even, so 14 / 2 = 7
#7 is odd, so 7 + 1 = 8
#8 is even, so 8 / 2 = 4
#4 is even, so 4 / 2 = 2
#2 is even, so 2 / 2 = 1
#
#Starting with 50, this sequence converges on 1 in 9
#iterations: 50 to 25, 25 to 26, 26 to 13, 13 to 14, 14 to
#7, 7 to 8, 8 to 4, 4 to 2, and 2 to 1.
#
#Implement a function called knox. knox should take as
#input an integer, and return the integer's Knox index;
#that is, the number of iterations it takes for the
#number to reach 1 following those rules. For example,
#knox(50) would return 9 because it took 9 iterations to
#converge on 1.

#Add your code here!
def knox(number):
    count = 0
    while number > 1:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            number /= 2
            count += 1
        else:
            number += 1
            count += 1
    return count


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: 9, 5, and 8, each on their own lines.

## Practice problem 8

#10th Street Trade School is a small university. It
#currently offers 12 majors: Accounting, Architecture,
#Astronomy, Business, Economics, History, Law, Medicine,
#Neuroscience, Physics, Psychology, and Zoology.
#
#10th Street's class-numbering structure is the same as
#Georgia Tech's: all classes have 4-digit numbers;
#undergraduate classes have numbers in the 1000s, 2000s,
#3000s, or 4000s, while graduate classes have numbers in
#the 6000s, 7000s, or 8000s.
#
#For three majors, 10th Street offers only undergraduate
#classes: Business, Architecture, and History. For three,
#it offers only graduate classes: Law, Medicine, and
#Neuroscience. For the other six, it offers both
#undergraduate and graduate classes.
#
#However, four majors are not offered during the summer:
#Business, Law, Architecture, and Accounting are only
#offered in Spring and Fall semesters.
#
#Write a function called check_class. check_class should
#require two positional arguments: a string for major
#name ("Astronomy", "Physics", etc.) and an integer for
#class number (1001, 6750, etc.). It should also have
#one keyword parameter: is_summer. is_summer should be
#False by default.
#
#check_class should return True if the class is valid,
#or False if it is not. A class is valid if (a) its
#major is one of the 12 majors listed above, (b) its
#class number is appropriate for the major (6000
#through 8999 for graduate-only majors, 1000 through
#4999 for undergraduate-only majors, or either for

## Practice problem 9
#The math we typically do is in base 10: adding 10 to one digit
#increments the next digit. Thus, the smallest (furthest right)
#number is the ones digit, the next smallest is the tens digit,
#the next smallest is the hundreds digit, etc. A 5 in the ones
#slot adds 5 to the total; a 5 in the tens slot adds 50 (5 * 10)
#to the total; a 5 in the hundreds slot adds 500 to the total
#(5 * 100), etc.
#
#Hexadecimal is a way of representing a different base, base 16.
#The digits 0 through 9 represent the normal numbers; A is 10,
#B is 11, C is 12, D is 13, E is 14, and F is 15. So, the
#hexadecimal number E is the standard number 14.
#
#Like base 10, hexadecimal has digit places: the ones digit, the
#16s digit, the 256s digit, and the 4096s digit. A 5 in the ones
#spot adds 5 to the total; in the 16s spot it adds 80 to the
#total (5 * 16), in the 256s spot it adds 1280 (5 * 256), and in
#the 4096s spot it adds 20480 (5 * 4096). In 4 digits, base 16
#can represent base 10 numbers up to 65,535 (16^4 - 1).
#
#Write a function called hex_to_decimal. hex_to_decimal will take
#one parameter, a string. You may assume the string will always
#have exactly 4 characters, and that all the characters will be
#a numeral from 0 to 9 or a capital letter from A to F. Return
#result of converting this hexadecimal number to a standard
#base-10 number.
